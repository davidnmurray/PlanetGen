# PlanetGen
This is an experimental repository to store my PlanetGen code.
(And an opportunity to do some more experimenting with GitHub.)
((In fact, that's really 90% of the point, but who knows, maybe someone will enjoy seeing PlanetGen?))

At the moment, PlanetGen is a work-in-progress, but there are various ambitions.
At the moment, PlanetGen allows you to enter some values, and computes some planetary characteristics based on them.
The main code is planet_gen.py, but it uses the modules UnitConv, GravityModule and EscapeVelModule,
so to use it, you need a bit more than just planet_gen itself.

This may, or may not, develop over time.
